- Being working student and a proud mom of three Balancing my time between work, school, and motherhood is not easy, but it has made me stronger and more determined. My children inspire me every day to keep going, even when I feel tired. Being a student while working helps me prove to myself and to my kids that it's never too late to chase your dreams. Every sacrifice I make now is for their future. I know the journey is difficult, but I believe that with faith, patience, and love, I can handle anything that comes my way. I see myself as a hardworking and loving mother who never gives up. Everything I do is for my children and the better life I want to give them.

## Area of Interest
- I’ve always had a big interest in motorcycles, traveling, and my work as an EMT. Riding a motorcycle gives me a sense of freedom and adventure, and it’s one of the ways I clear my mind while enjoying the road. Traveling is something I love because it allows me to see new places, meet different people, and experience things outside of my everyday routine. Being an EMT is also something I take pride in, since it gives me the chance to help others and make a real difference during emergencies. These three things may seem different, but together they keep me balanced, adventure, learning, and the opportunity to serve.
